## Description

Evocate is a basic game built to test the player's memory. In a deck of paired cards, the player needs to match each pair to win the game. Choosing a card will reveal the image until a second hidden card is chosen. If the card chosen matches the first card, the player scores a point. If not, both cards are hidden again and it is up to the player to memorize the cards until completion or the time runs out!
